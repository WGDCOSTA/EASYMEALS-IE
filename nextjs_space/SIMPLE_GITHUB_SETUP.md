# Simple GitHub Setup - EasyMeals.ie

## Quick 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Create the Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the form**:
   - Repository name: `easymeals-ie`
   - Description: `EasyMeals.ie - Modern eCommerce platform for ready-made meals with AI-powered nutrition tracking`
   - Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Leave all checkboxes **UNCHECKED**
     - Don't add README
     - Don't add .gitignore
     - Don't add license

3. **Click "Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Run the Push Script

Once the repository is created on GitHub, run this command:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/easymeals_ie/nextjs_space
./push-to-github.sh
```

The script will guide you through the process!

### Step 3: Authentication

When prompted for credentials:

**Username**: `WGDCOSTA`  
**Password**: Your GitHub Personal Access Token

#### Don't have a token? Create one:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Give it a name: `EasyMeals DeepAgent`
3. Select scope: **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
6. Use this token as your password when pushing

---

## That's It!

After these 3 steps, your code will be on GitHub at:
**https://github.com/WGDCOSTA/easymeals-ie**

### Future Commits

For future commits, use:
```bash
./commit-and-push.sh "Your commit message"
```

It will automatically commit and push your changes!

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using your **Personal Access Token**, not your GitHub password
- Token must have **repo** scope enabled

### "Repository not found"
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check that the repository name is exactly: `easymeals-ie`

### "Push rejected"
- The repository might have been initialized with files
- Try: `git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories`
- Then: `git push origin master`
